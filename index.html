                    <p>
                        We dream of a world where people are not judged on the basis of their gender, color, caste, religion, disability, ethinicity, financial status or just anything . We dream of a society where people stand together, hand in hand, supporting each other, helping each other grow. Where people respect one another and live in harmony, embracing the differences in all of us yet being together. We dream of a place with no religious or cultural barriers, where there's no distinction between blacks and whites and no differences in males and females. We dream of a world where people are not just human beings but where they know what being human means. Those are our dreams and our biggest dream is to transform all our dreams into reality. This is what our objective is.

                        <h4>Jackie Robinson</h4><br>
                        <p>He was the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era. He faced racism and hostility from fans, opponents, and even some teammates.</p>

                    </div>
                        <div class="inner">
                            <p>When Jackie Robinson took his position at first base at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947, American history changed forever. Becoming the first African-American in Major League Baseball in the 20th century, Robinson faced harsh criticism from fans, other players, and even his own teammates. As the season waned, however, the criticism diminished, and the praise grew.</p>
                            <p>In between, though, the Dodgers nearly had an internal uprising led by their Southern players, death threats poured into Robinson‚Äôs mail, the Philadelphia Phillies manager and players were warned by baseball‚Äôs commissioner for their excessive racial taunts during a game, and the St. Louis Cardinals may have attempted to strike rather than play on the same field as a Black man. Still, Robinson managed to fight through these issues to earn Rookie of the Year honors, and he helped lead the Dodgers into the 1947 World Series.</p>
